# virtual-background-replacementVirtual Background Replacement
A real-time virtual background replacement tool that leverages advanced image segmentation techniques to seamlessly replace video backgrounds without the need for a green screen.

✨ Features
Real-Time Processing: Instantly replaces backgrounds during live video streams.

No Green Screen Required: Utilizes machine learning models to detect and segment the human subject.

Custom Backgrounds: Supports static images as replacement backgrounds.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work across various operating systems.

📸 Demo

Demonstration of real-time background replacement in action.

🛠️ Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-background-replacement.git
cd virtual-background-replacement
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python virtual_background.py [path_to_background_image]
Replace [path_to_background_image] with the path to your desired background image.

⚙️ Usage
Upon running the application, your webcam feed will appear with the default background replaced.

To change the background, provide the path to your desired image as a command-line argument.

🧠 How It Works
The application employs a combination of color and edge-based features to detect the human subject in each video frame. A pretrained neural network model, trained on a vast dataset of human images, enhances the accuracy of segmentation. Once the subject is isolated, the original background is replaced with the user-selected image, ensuring a seamless visual experience.
